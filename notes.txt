NOTES TO SELF

Firebase troubleshooting:
If getting the error about scripts being disabled, run this command in console: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
OR TRY Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned (in PowerShell)

To post current version to firebase:
cd into the folder where the project lives
firebase init (if new directory)
firebase deploy
(Firebase is only installed on PC right now, if on laptop just push to Github)
